<p>Hi, my name is Abu and I go to the University of Rhode Island, I am currently a sophmore and I love URI because a lot of my friends are here and I have fun but when it comes down to doing my work I like to go to the library. I usually like to pick times throught the day when I get to have fun and when I get to focused on my work and study, it really just depends on my class schedule that day. When I want to have fun I usually play basketball or hangout with friends. </p>
