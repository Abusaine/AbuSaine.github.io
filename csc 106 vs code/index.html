 <h1>Welcome to Abu's programing portfolio!</h1>
<p>welcome to my website!</p>
Hi my name is Abu and this website is About me and what I like to do. I've already added links to what I like to do but I want to tell you again anyway. I like to spend time with friends, play video games and I also like playing basketball. doing those 3 things help me to cope with whatever I'm going through and If i'm not going through anything at the time I do it just for fun.
